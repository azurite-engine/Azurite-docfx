  summary: "Represents a basic camera. The purpose of a digital camera capturing a digital point of view is to translate the 3D locations in game onto the 2 dimensions of your monitor (if you come from the future with holograms in it, Hi! welcome to the past!) The camera does so by way of linear algebra; points in 3D space can be projected onto a 2D plane using matrix transformations.\n\nSpecifically, the digital camera used in this engine is composed of two matrices: the projection and the view matrices. The projection matrix is used to define an in game width and height to your perspective by defining how many in-game coordinate units can be seen horizontally and vertically on your monitor. The view matrix defines the direction and orientation of the camera; it's usually the matrix defined in terms of camera position, pitch, and yaw."
